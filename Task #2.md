# what is class
**class in oop** is a way of organizing data and deviding it into sections "classes" and these classes then devided into groups "functions".
using class is necessary for writing a clean organized code to be easier in modification and read, instead of writing all the souce cod in the main class.
class performs a set of properties and methods that are shared by all objects created from that class. The properties represent the characteristics of objects,
while the methods define the behavior. 
# what is object
**object** is an instance of a class and each object has its own unique set of properties, values, and methods.
To create an object, you first define a class and then create an instance of that class.

# diffrence between class & object
The main difference between a class and an object is that a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects, while an object is a specific instance of 
a class that has its own unique set of properties and methods.

# summary
Classes provide a way to organize and encapsulate data and behavior into reusable, modular units, making it easier
to develop and maintain complex software systems. Objects allow developers to work with specific instances of a class, manipulating
data and invoking methods to perform specific actions.
