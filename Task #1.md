# What is web
It is all started by a connection between two or more computers "systems" to share files till it grown to share and access these files from anywhere and for anyone and this connection named by internet. these files that can be accessed from anywhere are stored in webservers displayed on webpage and can be accessed through web search engine.

## So web app consitis of two main parts
+ **client side**
```
which refers to a method of accessing and using web-based resources, where the client is the end-user's device, such as a computer or mobile phone, 
that interacts with the server to obtain or display web content.

When you enter a website address into your browser, it sends a request to a web server using tcp handshake. 
The web server then retrieves the requested content and sends it back to the browser. these browsers display the content, which is executed within
the browser to enhance the functionality and interactivity of the web application.. 
This process is called a client-server model, which is a way of distributing the workload between two types of computers: clients and servers.
```
+ **server side**
```
The server-side model in web architecture refers to a method of processing and generating web content on the server-side, before it is sent to the 
client's device for display.

server side consists of bunch of things 

   1-  Web server software: The web server software is the foundation of the server-side architecture, responsible for handling incoming requests from clients 
       and serving content in response.

   2- Server-side programming languages: There are many programming languages that can be used for server-side development, including PHP, Java, Ruby, 
      Python, and others.These languages allow developers to write server-side code to process data and generate dynamic web content.

   3- Database management systems: Server-side applications often rely on databases to store and retrieve data. 
     Common database management systems used in server-side development include MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL.

   4- Server-side frameworks: Server-side frameworks provide a set of tools and libraries to simplify server-side development, helping developers to build 
      server-side applications more efficiently. Some popular server-side frameworks include Laravel for PHP, Spring for Java, Ruby on Rails for Ruby,
      and Django for Python.

   5- APIs and web services: Server-side applications often expose APIs and web services that can be consumed by client-side applications or other 
      server-side applications. These APIs and web services provide a standardized way to access and share data between applications.

# Overall
>**the server-side model:** allows for dynamic and interactive web content to be generated on the server-side before being sent to the client for display.

>**the client model:**  refers to the role of the end-user's device in interacting with web servers to obtain and display web resources.
